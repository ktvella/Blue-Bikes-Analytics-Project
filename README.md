## Bluebikes Analytics Project

Data Analytics project looking at Bluebike data from January 2020 through May 2024. This project is to practice data analytics skills like data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

Data is cleaned by splitting columns to give more granular data, removing outliers, and updating data types. 
Then correlations between variables are explored to find which ones most strongly correlate with ridership. The answers may surprise you!
